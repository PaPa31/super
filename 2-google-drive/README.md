You don't need to install `installbackupandsync.exe` at all.
You need to install `GoogleDriveSetup.exe` right away.

If you first install `installbackupandsync.exe`, then after a while you will prompted to install GoogleDrive.

I left `installbackupandsync.exe` here because `GoogleDrive` is still raw.
